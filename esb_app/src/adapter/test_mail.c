/* Notice that we're returning MUNIT_FAIL instead of writing an
   * error message.  Error messages are generally preferable, since
   * they make it easier to diagnose the issue, but this is an
   * option.
   *
   * Possible values are:
   *  - MUNIT_OK: Sucess
   *  - MUNIT_FAIL: Failure
   *  - MUNIT_SKIP: The test was skipped; usually this happens when a
   *    particular feature isn't in use.  For example, if you're
   *    writing a test which uses a Wayland-only feature, but your
   *    application is running on X11.
   *  - MUNIT_ERROR: The test failed, but not because of anything you
   *    wanted to test.  For example, maybe your test downloads a
   *    remote resource and tries to parse it, but the network was
   *    down.
